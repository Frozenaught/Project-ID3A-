# [Project Idea] Alarm Clock
Make a program that accepts command line arguments for what time to go off, and when it does it should launch a You tube video in your browser that will start playing.

The program should read in a text file that contains URLs to different Youtube videos and will randomly choose one and launch it. My command line args were in the form of --hour <hour> --minute <minute> --<pm/am> but you should do whatever you feel is easiest or most convenient for you.

# Soundboard (x post r/ learn python)
As the title says we will be making a soundboard that has a gui and a multitude (more than one) of song clips. Any package is allowed and this will be a great intro to basic GUI building.

*Bonus points if you: Somehow manage to use Snack (I couldn't for the life of me), can multi-thread a stop button and/or explain to me why the audio quality was terrible when pygame was used (on multiple devices)


# A simple game that outputs different outcomes defined by the users input.
verify the age of the user or that the user is human

accept some input

output results based on users input

I'm just a month in to learning python and this was my first attempt at making something, based it off the age verify post awhile back. Advice on my code, or anyone else's attempt would be awesome.

# Analytics and graphing using python
I am new to python, and have to create a project for one of my classes that provides useful information. I am having a lot of trouble figuring it out, and I think it is above my skill level in using python. I decided to use the dataset at this link. http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/campus-safety-and-security-survey-2013 To graph the percentage of on and off campus total arrests of certain schools. Doesn't matter which ones, you can pick 5-10. But I do not know how to write code to graph them. Any help would be great.

# Digital display for nums 0-9 on button press.
Using whichever display method of choice. Create digital display characters of the numbers 0-9 on a button press. I initially typed one out using tkinter as a self challenge. I imagine that this single digit display can be combined with several tkinter canvas widgets (some editing of course) to make as many units as needed side by side for a calculator, clock, counter, etc.

# Battleship [Project]
Battleship is a simple, yet complex game of placing different types of boats on a 10x10 grid and then trying to guess where your opponent placed their ships. For the rest of the rules check here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game) So make it in python (Bonus points if your code has a unique feature about it!)

# Python bot to download all your Instagram Gallery photos in a single folder
Simple as that.

I was frustrated because of lack of download feature in instagram. They should have allowed it at least for the photos you own. Anyway, that triggered me to create this bot that will download all your gallery images that you uploaded in a single folder. Sweet, eh ?

Get access token

Run the .exe

# Code for Archived Project (Version 3)
Hey everyone,

I completed an archived project and I was hoping you guys could take a look at my code (http://pastebin.com/hmvFM97A) when you get a chance. Here is the project info:

"GOAL Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall." This should be a pretty simple program, so to make it a bit harder, here are some rules to follow. RULES If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function. Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics. Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular. Put a blank line between each verse of the song."

# [challenge] Rock paper Scissors
If you don't know what to do next, Why not make Rock paper Scissors. It is a beginners project and uses "import random" and for even better quality "import time"

# [PROJECT] Roman Numeral -> Integer Converter
Here's a simple project that has a lot of room for expansion. Make a program that takes a user's roman numeral combination or their integer and converts it to the other type. The translations can stop at 4999 (due to restrictions of the roman numeral system).

Bonus 1: design your program so it's capable of translating either type of input.

Bonus 2: detect non-translatable inputs like numbers >= 5000 or 'XVIV'.

Bonus 3: create a simple GUI

# [CHALLENGE] Utilize beginner web-scraping techniques to create a randomized vocabulary quizzer
Let me preface this by saying this is my current project that I'm designing for myself as means to teach myself Python. It's relatively easy but accomplishes quite a bit with just beginner techniques.

If you are unfamiliar with web scraping, check out this YouTuber's series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7wB__M9fdw

Use https://www.randomlists.com/random-vocabulary-words to generate a random list of 5 vocabulary words to test your user with. Scrape the words and definitions from the page source code to create a quiz-type of your choice. Two suggestions for the type of quiz would be 1) a multiple choice quiz with instances of one of the scraped word and a randomized list of the 5 scraped definitions for the user to choose from. This quiz would optimally give the user a score at the end so they can't use deductive reasoning to gain an edge. 2-harder option) A quiz that provides the scraped words and definitions in two separate lists. These lists would have the items labeled something like a) word1, b)word2 and x)definition1, y)definition2 -- or however you may like to list them. The quiz would prompt the user to for inputs like 'AZ', matching the word to the definition they think is correct. This quiz would be completed once 5 pairs have been submitted and the user will be given a score.

# [Project]Days of Each Month

Your GOAL is to design a program that displays the number of days in each month. The program's output should be similar to this:

January has 31 days.
February has 28 days.
March has 31 days.
April has 30 days.
May has 31 days.
June has 30 days.
July has 31 days.
August has 31 days.
September has 30 days.
October has 31 days.
November has 30 days.
December has 31 days.

The program should have two parallel arrays: a 12-element String array that is initialized with the names of the months, and a 12-element Integer array that is initialized with the number of days in each month. To produce the output specified, use a loop to step through the arrays getting the name of a month and the number of days in that month.

# [Project] Turn Based RPG
I'm remaking this post because the last RPG project is archived So for this code, the basic principles of RPG apply, so the code should contain:

A random encounter generator

Four attacks that do different amounts of damage

Enemies that fight back

And a user action or an enemy action will count as a turn

Finally the game ends when someone has zero health (No negatives!)

# [project] Recognize video-game covers in a photo and retrieve the title and platform from it
Hello all pythonic redditors :)

I am truly new to computer vision field, but it is fascinating me! I have now a challenge in my hands and I am seeking for mentors/advisers to give me some follow up.

My project is:

I take a picture of a video-game cover, and I will search that pic through a video-game cover database, and if there is a very good match the app will return a string with the name of the videogame and the platform available to.

Example of the procediment/problem: 1 -Take a photo of a cover: http://gamerstorm.ucoz.net/Retro_Blog/FIFA_12/DSCF0605.jpg 2 - Cover match to this in the database: http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/329/1982494-fifa_12_ps2_cover.png 3 - App gives string: "Fifa 12 Playstation 2"

As i said, i have very little background from Computer Vision, but i already have done some research. So far, and by myself, I have read that I should save in my database, the name of the game, the platform, imagehash and the image features (by this I mean SURF keypoints and descriptors).

I have already a script that works very good but now I am concerned with speed... I need my search to be faster... it is taking only 0,009 seconds to search for similar hashes and 2 secs to match keypoints by BruteForce(L2 distance) ... seems quite fast but this is only by 1 image query against only 100 images... and my real database has more than 4700 covers... :/

Other thing that is bugging me is that I am saving the 4700 image details in a dict that then I save to a pickle... but that pickle file is HUGE... it has 15 GB :/ and is taking 2hours to load (unpickle) the data...

Any suggestions?

ps: I am using Python so...

# Text Editor
GOAL:

Create a simple text editor that can read, write and rename. Refer to this source code if you're stuck but don't copy it.

SUBGOAL:

1:

GUI, use any library of your choice for creating a graphical text editor.

# [Project] Random Profession
Goal:

Create a program that takes three string as an argument and uses the random.choice() function for choosing one of them. It might be a good idea to print out something like "You would be a <programmer> when you grow up". Note:

<programmer> is what random.choice() returned.

Subgoals:

How about some Object Oriented Programming? Make use of some def() functions.

# [Project] There are ___ number of 1 in this paragraph...
Goals: Create a program that fills in the blanks (with numbers) so that the paragraph is logically true.

There are ___ number of 1 in this paragraph

There are ___ number of 2 in this paragraph

There are ___ number of 3 in this paragraph

There are ___ number of 4 in this paragraph

Bonus: Let the user input the number of lines to the problem.

Edit: When the number of lines = 6, there is no soloution

# [Project] Capital Cities
Goals

Create a program that will take the name of a state or province and tell the user its capital city. Support the reverse operation as well. Can you expand this to national capitals?

Hint

Instead of typing all the information yourself, try automating the process by scraping it from a website.

# [Project] Web Search
Goal

Create a program that will take a string as an argument, open the web browser, and search for the string using the search engine of your choice.

Bonus

Allow the program to get the string from the clipboard instead of the command line.

Support multiple search engines. Allow the user to choose which one to use via command-line argument. Allow the user to set a default search engine so they don't have to specify it every time.

# [Project] Maps and Directions
Inspired by Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.

Goal

Create a program that will get a map for a street address. It must take an address as a command-line argument and open the browser to the Google Maps (or another map program of your choice) map of the address.

Bonus

Instead of only taking the address as an argument, allow it to read it from the clipboard. This way you can map an address without having to type it in every time.

Allow the user to get directions from one address to another. If the maps program allows directions via waypoints (e.g., A to B to C), support an arbitrary number of waypoints.

Allow the user to save addresses with a simple name ("home" or "work", for example) and map the address using the name. If you're allowing them to get directions, let them use the name to refer to a place (e.g., get directions from "home" to "work").

# [Project] Verifying a user's age
Sometimes a site might not be appropriate for people of a certain age. For times like these, we'll need a program that verifies the user's age, to ensure that they can view the site.

GOAL

Create a program that makes sure that the user is of an age of your choice (18 being the default).

SUB GOALS

Have the user input their birthday, and use that to determine if they are old enough

If the user is not of an appropriate age, suggest a different website/websites that would be appropriate for them

# [Project] Create a news program with reddit api
I'm feeling a bit lazy, fetch me my paper.

Goals:

Get the api to work

Present the 30 posts to the user in a format of your choice

To go above and beyond:

Create a gui, and give me a link to the story that opens up in a browser.

Allow the user to upvote/downvote

# [Project] Finding averages
You must make a tool that takes the users input and outputs the average of the input.

Goal

Take the users input (A series of numbers)

Calculate the Mean (Sum of all numbers divided by the amount of numbers)

Calculate the Mode (The number that occurs the most)

Calculate the median (The middle number when sorted in ascending order)

Output these averages

Extra info

# Rock Paper Scissors
You must make a rock paper scissors game

Goal

Ask the player if they pick rock paper or scissors

Have the computer chose its move

Compare the choices and decide who wins

Print the results

Subgoals

Let the player play again

Keep a record of the score e.g. (Player: 3 / Computer: 6)

# [Project] Multiplication Table
You remember those multiplication tables from elementary school, right? The ones where you choose a number on the top row and one on the side and see where they meet on the chart? Good. It would be easy enough to just write it out, but let's try using Python to our advantage.

Goal

Create a program that prints out a multiplication table for the numbers 1 through 9. It should include the numbers 1 through 9 on the top and left axises, and it should be relatively easy to find the product of two numbers. Do not simply write out every line manually (ie print('7 14 21 28 35 49 56 63') ).

Subgoals

As your products get larger, your columns will start to get crooked from the number of characters on each line. Clean up your table by evenly spacing columns so it is very easy to find the product of two numbers.

Allow the user to choose a number to change the size of the table (so if they type in 12, the table printed out should be a 12x12 multiplication table).

# [Project]Create a dice simulator
Goals You are about to play a board game, but you realize you don't have any dice. Fortunately you have this program.

Create a program that opens a new window and draws 2 six-sided dice

Allow the user to quit, or roll again

Bonus

Allow the user to select the number of dice to be drawn on screen(1-4)

Add up the total of the dice and display it

# [Project] Magic 8 Ball
Goal

I'm sure you've used a magic 8 ball at one point in your life. You ask it a question, turn it right side up and it gives an answer by way of a floating die with responses written on it. You can create one in python. You must:

Allow the user to enter their question

Display an in progress message( i.e. "thinking")

Create 20 responses, and show a random response

Allow the user to ask another question or quit

Bonus Using whatever module you like, add a gui. Your gui must have:

A box for users to enter the question

At least 4 buttons: Ask , clear(the text box), play again and quit(this must close the window)

# [Project] Random Wikipedia Article
Background

If you've been to Wikipedia, you may have noticed that there is a link to a random article on the left side of the screen. While it can be fun to see what article you get taken to, sometimes it would be nice to see the name of the article so you can skip it if it sounds boring. Luckily, Wikipedia has an API that allows us to do so (Click here).

However, there is a dilemma. Since Wikipedia has articles about topics from all over the world, some of them have special characters in the title. For example, the article about the spanish painter Erasto Cortés Juárez has é and á in it. If you look at this specific article's API, you will see that the title is "Erasto Cort\u00e9s Ju\u00e1rez" and that the \u00e9 and \u00e1 are replacing the two previously mentioned letters. (For information about what this is, start by checking out the first half of this page in the documentation). To make your program work, you're going to have to handle this problem somehow.

Goal

Create a program that pulls titles from the official Wikipedia API and then asks the user one by one if he or she would like to read about that article. So if the first title is Reddit, then the program should ask something along the lines of "Would you like to read about Reddit?" If the user says yes, then the program should open up the article for the user to read.

HINT: Mouse over the hidden area below to see how the article's ID can be used to access the actual article. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39608394

Subgoals

As mentioned before, do something about the possibility of unicode appearing in the title. Whether you want your program to simply filter out these articles or you want to actually turn the codes into readable characters, that's up to you.

Make the program pause once the user has selected an article to read, and allow him or her to continue browsing different article titles once finished reading.

Allow the user to simply press ENTER to be asked about a new article.

# [Project] Dice Rolling Simulator
Goal

By using the random module, python can do things like pseudo-random number generation. So in this program, allow the user to input the amount of sides on a dice and how many times it should be rolled. From there, your program should simulate dice rolls and keep track of how many times each number comes up (this does not have to be displayed). After that, print out how many times each number came up.

Subgoal

Adjust your program so that if the user does not type in a number when they need to, the program will keep prompting them to type in a real number until they do so.

Put the program into a loop so that the user can continue to simulate dice rolls without having to restart the entire program.

In addition to printing out how many times each side appeared, also print out the percentage it appeared. If you can, round the percentage to 4 digits total OR two decimal places.

# [Project] Hangman Game
Goal

Create a program that selects a random word and then allows the user to guess it in a game of hangman. Like the real game, there should be blank spots for each letter in the word, and a part of the body should be added each time the user guesses a letter than is not in the answer (you may choose how many wrong turns the user can make until the game ends).

Subgoals

If the user loses, print out the word at the end of the game.

Create a "give up" option.

# [Project] Watch for new TIL facts
Background

If you finished the previous project which compared the karma of two new comments, hopefully you learned a thing or two about receiving data from Reddit's API. Now you're going to take this a step further, and even have the opportunity to make a basic twitter bot.

Goal

Create a program that receives data from the r/todayilearned subreddit, and looks for new facts that have been posted. Each time the program comes across a new fact, the fact should be printed into the command line. However, phrases like "TIL ", "TIL that", etc should be removed so the only thing that is printed is the fact.

>>New TIL API data here<<

There are a couple things to note about this since you'll more than likely be using a loop to check for new posts. According to Reddit's API Access Rules Page, the API pages are only updated once every thirty seconds, so you'll have to have your code pause for at least thirty seconds before it tries to find more posts. Secondly, if for some reason you decide to try to get data sooner than every thirty seconds, make sure to not send more than thirty requests per minute. That is the maximum you are allowed to do.

Subgoal Ideas

There is actually a lot you can do once your program starts receiving facts. Instead of simply printing the facts, here are some ideas for what you can do with them. If you currently do not feel like you can accomplish these ideas, feel free to come back later when you have more experience.

Print the link to the source of the fact too.

Try to further clean up the fact by adding punctuation to the end if it is missing, capitalize the first word, etc.

Write the facts to a separate text file so you end up with a giant compilation of random facts.

Create a bot that posts the facts to twitter. This may sound hard, but it's actually pretty simple by using the "Python Twitter Tools" module and following the guide posted here. Remember, the maximum amount of characters you can use in a tweet is only 140, so you'll have to filter out facts that are longer than that.

By now you should be pretty familiar with python, so if you get ideas for improving your program, go for it!

# [Project] Coin Estimator By Weight
When some people receive change after shopping, they put it into a container and let it add up over time. Once they fill up the container, they'll roll them up in coin wrappers which can then be traded in at a bank for what they are worth. While most banks will give away coin wrappers for free, it's convenient to have an idea of how many you will need. Instead of counting how many coins you have, it's easier to separate all of your coins, weigh them, and then estimate how many of each type you have and then how many wrappers you'll need.

For example, if you weigh all of your dimes and see that you have 1276.9g of them, you can estimate that you have about 563 dimes (since each one is 2.268g) and you would be able to fill 11 dime wrappers.

Goal Create a program that allows the user to input the total weight of each type of coin they have (pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters), and then print out how many of each type of wrapper they would need, how many coins they have, and the estimated total value of all of their money.

Weight of each coin and how many fit inside each type of wrapper.

Subgoals

Round all numbers printed out to the nearest whole number.

Allow the user to select whether they want to submit the weight in either grams or pounds.

# [Project] Compare Recent Karma
Background

Since we're all redditors here, let's make something dealing with reddit. If you go to a user's profile and add .json to the end of it, you can get the all sorts of Json data about the user (think of Json as a giant dictionary of smaller dictionaries and lists). For example, if I go to my own profile and view it's Json data, it would look like this. At first it might look intimidating, but if you break it down, you can see it's just one giant dictionary with all sorts of information about my latest posts.

Goal

Create a program that gets information about two different users, and then sees whose most recent post received the most karma. The program should then print out which user received more karma, and what the difference was. This is a pretty open project, so I encourage you to take it further by adding more features if you find it interesting.

Remember - Elements in a list are referenced by their index numbers while entries in a dictionary are referenced by their keys.

Subgoals

Allow the user to put in the name of two different users when the program first begins.

If one of the names of the users does not exist (because of a spelling error), print out a message saying so.

Allow the user to keep comparing other users until the program is closed.

Display the amount of upvotes and downvotes each user received for their posts.

# [Project] Mad Libs Story Maker
Background

Ever played Mad Libs? If you haven't, here's the basic's of it.

"Mad Libs consist of a book that has a short story on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a lexical or other category, such as "noun", "verb", "place", or "part of the body".[10] One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute some word for the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical."

Goal

Create a Mad Libs style game, where the program asks the user for certain types of words, and then prints out a story with the words that the user inputted. The story doesn't have to be too long, but it should have some sort of story line.

Tip - It's easiest to write out a quick story on a piece of paper or a word document, and then go back through and see which words the user should be able to change.

Subgoals

If the user has to put in a name, change the first letter to a capital letter.

Change the word "a" to "an" when the next word in the sentence begins with a vowel.


# [Challenge] Count and Fix Green Eggs and Ham

Some of you may remember the Dr. Sues story "Green Eggs and Ham". For those of you that don't remember it or have never heard of it, here is the story. However, there is a problem with the story I gave you - every time the word I is used, it is lowercase.

Because of this problem, your job is to do the following...

Copy the story I gave you into a regular text file.

Create a program that reads through the story and makes the letter i uppercase any time it should be. (Make sure to change it when it's used in sam-I-am's name too.)

Have your program make a new file, and have it write out the story correctly.

Print out how many errors were corrected.

When you're finished, you should have corrected this many errors.

# [Function] Mean, Median, and Mode

Background

In a set of numbers, the mean is the average, the mode is the number that occurs the most, and if you rearrange all the numbers numerically, the median is the number in the middle.

Goal

Create three functions that allow the user to find the mean, median, and mode of a list of numbers. If you have access or know of functions that already complete these tasks, do not use them.

Subgoals

In the mean function, give the user a way to select how many decimal places they want the answer to be rounded to.

If there is an even number of numbers in the list, return both numbers that could be considered the median.

If there are multiple modes, return all of them.

# [Project] What's the Weather?
Background

If you would like to know the basics of what an API is, check out this post by iamapizza. http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/qowts/eli5_what_is_api/c3z9kok

Goal

Create a program that pulls data from OpenWeatherMap.org that prints out information about the current weather, such as the high, the low, and the amount of rain for wherever you live. Depending on how skilled you are, you can actually do some neat stuff with this project.

Subgoals

Print out data for the next 5-7 days so you have a 5 day/week long forecast.

Print the data to another file that you can open up and view at, instead of viewing the information in the command line.

If you know html, write a file that you can print information to so that your project is more interesting. Here is an example of the results from what I threw together.

Tips

APIs that are in Json are essentially lists and dictionaries. Remember that to reference something in a list, you must refer to it by what number element it is in the list, and to reference a key in a dictionary, you must refer to it by it's name.

Don't like Celsius? Add &units=imperial to the end of the URL of the API to receive your data in Fahrenheit.

# [Challenge] What's My Number
Between 1 and 1000, there is only 1 number that meets the following criteria. While it could be manually figured out with pen and paper, it would be much more efficient to write a program that would do this for you. With that being said, your goal is to find out which number meets these criteria. To find out if you have the correct number, click the link at the bottom of this main post.

The number has two or more digits.

The number is prime.

The number does NOT contain a 1 or 7 in it.

The sum of all of the digits is less than or equal to 10.

The first two digits add up to be odd.

The second to last digit is even.

The last digit is equal to how many digits are in the number.

# [PROJECT]Menu Calculator
GOAL

Imagine you have started up a small restaurant and are trying to make it easier to take and calculate orders. Since your restaurant only sells 9 different items, you assign each one to a number, as shown below.

Chicken Strips - $3.50

French Fries - $2.50

Hamburger - $4.00

Hotdog - $3.50

Large Drink - $1.75

Medium Drink - $1.50

Milk Shake - $2.25

Salad - $3.75

Small Drink - $1.25

To quickly take orders, your program should allow the user to type in a string of numbers and then it should calculate the cost of the order. For example, if one large drink, two small drinks, two hamburgers, one hotdog, and a salad are ordered, the user should type in 5993348, and the program should say that it costs $19.50. Also, make sure that the program loops so the user can take multiple orders without having to restart the program each time.

SUBGOALS

If you decide to, print out the items and prices every time before the user types in an order.

Once the user has entered an order, print out how many of each item have been ordered, as well as the total price. If an item was not ordered at all, then it should not show up.

# [PROJECT] Countdown Clock
GOAL

Create a program that allows the user to choose a time and date, and then prints out a message at given intervals (such as every second) that tells the user how much longer there is until the selected time.

SUBGOALS

If the selected time has already passed, have the program tell the user to start over.

If your program asks for the year, month, day, hour, etc. separately, allow the user to be able to type in either the month name or its number.

TIP: Making use of built in modules such as time and datetime can change this project from a nightmare into a much simpler task.

# [PROJECT] Turn Based Pokemon Style Game
GOAL

Write a simple game that allows the user and the computer to take turns selecting moves to use against each other. Both the computer and the player should start out at the same amount of health (such as 100), and should be able to choose between the three moves:

The first move should do moderate damage and has a small range (such as 18-25).

The second move should have a large range of damage and can deal high or low damage (such as 10-35).

The third move should heal whoever casts it a moderate amount, similar to the first move.

After each move, a message should be printed out that tells the user what just happened, and how much health the user and computer have. Once the user or the computer's health reaches 0, the game should end.

SUBGOALS

When someone is defeated, make sure the game prints out that their health has reached 0, and not a negative number.

When the computer's health reaches a set amount (such as 35%), increase it's chance to cast heal.

Give each move a name.

# [FUNCTION] Factors of a Number
GOAL

Define a function that creates a list of all the numbers that are factors of the user's number. For example, if the function is called factor, factor(36) should return [1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36]. The numbers in your list should be from least to greatest, and 1 and the original number should be included.

# [FUNCTION]Fibonacci Sequence
BACKGROUND INFORMATION If you do not know about the Fibonacci Sequence, read the information on MathIsFun.com.

GOAL

Define a function that allows the user to find the value of the nth term in the sequence. To make sure you've written your function correctly, test the first 10 numbers of the sequence. Remember, the 0th term is 0 and the first and second term are both 1.

# [PROJECT] A Variation of 21
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

If you do not know how 21 (AKA Blackjack) is played, reading the first couple of paragraphs of this wikipedia article may be beneficial.

MAIN GOAL

In this project, you will make a game similar to 21/blackjack. Since this is not an actual game (as far as I'm aware of), here the the instructions for how to play.

In this version, there is only one player, and there are two types of scores - the round score and the game score. The game score will begin at 100, and the game will last for five rounds.

At the beginning of the round, the player is given two random cards from a deck and they will be added together to make the player's round score. From here, the player has two options - draw another card to try to get their round score closer to 21, or they can end the round. The player can draw as many cards as they want until they end the round or their round score exceeds 21.

At the end of the round, the difference between 21 and the round score is subtracted from the game score, and then the next round begins. After the five rounds, the player is given their total score and the game is over.

---Other Information About The Game---

Aces are only worth 1.

If a player busts, 21 is subtracted from their total score.

All face cards are worth 10.

So the point of your program is to allow the user to play the game described above. Many of the subgoals listed below can be added to shine up the game.

SUBGOALS

At the beginning of each round, print the round number (1 to 5).

Since this is a text base game, tell the user what is happening. For example, tell him/her when he/she draws a card, the name of the card, when they bust, etc.

Create a ranking system at the end of the game and tell the user their rank. For example, if the player finishes with 50-59 points they get an F, 60-69 is a D, 70-79 is a C, 80-89 is a B, and 90-100 is an A.

At the end of each round, print out the user's total score.

This may be the hardest part of the project, depending on how you wrote it. Make sure the deck has 4 of each type of card, and then remove cards as they are drawn. At the end of each round, make the deck have all of the cards again.

# [PROJECT] 99 Bottles of Beer On the Wall Lyrics
GOAL

Create a program that prints out every line to the song "99 bottles of beer on the wall." This should be a pretty simple program, so to make it a bit harder, here are some rules to follow.

RULES

If you are going to use a list for all of the numbers, do not manually type them all in. Instead, use a built in function.

Besides the phrase "take one down," you may not type in any numbers/names of numbers directly into your song lyrics.

Remember, when you reach 1 bottle left, the word "bottles" becomes singular.

Put a blank line between each verse of the song.

# [PROJECT] Pythagorean Triples Checker
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

If you do not know how basic right triangles work, read this article on wikipedia.

MAIN GOAL

Create a program that allows the user to input the sides of any triangle, and then return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.

SUBGOALS

If your program requires users to input the sides in a specific order, change the coding so the user can type in the sides in any order. Remember, the hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.

Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.

# [PROJECT] Higher-Lower Guessing Game
BASIC GOAL Create a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 and the user has to guess what the number is. After every guess, the computer should tell the user if the guess is higher or lower than the answer. When the user guesses the correct number, print out a congratulatory message.

SUB GOALS

Add an introduction message that explains to the user how to play your game.

In addition to the congratulatory message at the end of the game, also print out how many guesses were taken before the user arrived at the correct answer.

At the end of the game, allow the user to decide if they want to play again (without having to restart the program).

# [PROJECT] Change Calculator
BASIC GOAL Imagine that your friend is a cashier, but has a hard time counting back change to customers. Create a program that allows him to input a certain amount of change, and then print how how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are needed to make up the amount needed.

For example, if he inputs 1.47, the program will tell that he needs 5 quarters, 2 dimes, 0 nickels, and 2 pennies.

SUBGOALS

So your friend doesn't have to calculate how much change is needed, allow him to type in the amount of money given to him and the price of the item. The program should then tell him the amount of each coin he needs like usual.

To make the program even easier to use, loop the program back to the top so your friend can continue to use the program without having to close and open it every time he needs to count change.
